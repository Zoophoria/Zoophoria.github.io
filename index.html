							<h2>About Us</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Animals are our passion. We strive to not only educate the public on wildlife, but also to assist organizations in conservation efforts. Currently we utilize two outlets to achieve these goals. First and foremost, we design and sell clothing as part of a campaign. Our campaigns are constantly changing and each one has a focus on the conservation efforts of a specific animal. For every article of clothing sold, 15% of the profits are donated to organizations that work in effort to conserve and protect the animals featured on the clothing. Our current campaign can always be seen by simply scrolling down on this page. Secondly, we regularly publish videos on our YouTube channel discussing everything and anything about animals. We hope that in doing this more people will be able to learn about wildlife conservation and will in turn hopefully support future conservation efforts. Zoophoria was created for one purpose, to assist, protect, and conserve wildlife; with that mission in mind, we hope for you to join us on this journey and we thank everyon and anyone for supporting our cause.   </p>
